## Steps to bootstrap a new Mac

1. Install Apple's Command Line Tools, which are prerequisites for Git and Homebrew.

```zsh
xcode-select --install
```

2. Clone repo into new hidden directory.

```zsh
# Use SSH (if set up)...
git clone git@github.com:imcodingideas/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

# ...or use HTTPS and switch remotes later.
git clone https://github.com/imcodingideas/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

3. Create symlinks in the Home directory to the real files in the repo.

```zsh
./install
```

4. Install Homebrew, followed by the software listed in the Brewfile.

```zsh
# These could also be in an install script.

# Install Homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Then pass in the Brewfile location...
brew bundle --file ~/.dotfiles/Brewfile

# ...or move to the directory first.
cd ~/.dotfiles && brew bundle
```

5. To maintain a healthy Brewfile
```zsh
# The describe flag adds comments above the brew name
brew bundle dump --describe --force

# Update the lock file and install
brew bundle --file=Brewfile
```
